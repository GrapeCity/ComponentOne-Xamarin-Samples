# ComponentOne Xamarin Samples 

Add cross-platform business controls to your iOS, Android, and UWP mobile apps.

This repository contains the samples for [ComponentOne Studio for Xamarin](https://developer.mescius.com/componentone/xamarin-ui-controls). These samples provide complete implementation details for the Xamarin.Forms, Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android features. They are also included with the full download and install from developer.mescius.com/componentone. 

The samples reference, but do not include, the control packages. The control packages can be downloaded from nuget.org.

## Building a Sample 

Xamarin samples require Visual Studio 2017, Android 4.2 (API 17), iOS 10 and above. Run these commands from the CLI in the directory of any sample: 

```
dotnet build 
dotnet run 
```
This will install any needed dependencies, build the project, and run the project respectively.
